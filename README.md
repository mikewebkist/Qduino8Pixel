# Qduino8Pixel
Test sketch for the Qduino Mini

Wire a button to `BUTTON_PIN` and a NeoPixel strip to `NEOPIXEL_PIN`. On powerup the battery charge level will display in both binary and graph format. Holding down the button after startup clears will incrementally light pixels until full. Continue to hold and the battery charge indicator will re-run.
